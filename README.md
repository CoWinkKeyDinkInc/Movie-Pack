Movie-Pack
==========

A Minecraft resource pack to assist in Minecraft machinimas.

Some Changes in the resource pack by default
--------------------------------------------
- Beacons, command blocks, gold blocks, gold ore and other blocks animate!
- Clearer water.
- Bits added from [Tiggy's Pack][1] and [Plast-Pack][2].
- Explosions are full colour!
- Sun and Moon are rounder!
- Even more!

Using issues and pull requests
------------------------------
If you want something added to the Movie-Pack, like a font, animation or
something else, you may create an issue asking it to be added. There has to be a
good reason to get something added to the resource pack.

If you want to request a texture to be solely used for aesthetics, you must have at least a 16x resolution image.
Fonts, items, paintings, entities and others can be requested at any resolution.

Other
-----
- If you're looking for a 32x pack to go with this, try out the [Upscaled Pack][3] a copyright free alternative to Vattic's 32x pack.
- This resource pack is mostly sutiable for snapshots, go to the releases tab for versions sutiable for older versions of Minecraft.
- I ask that you put a link to this repository if you use this in your videos.
